# FUTURE_FEATURES.md

This is the canonical **future-feature backlog** for `auto-architect`.
Use it when selecting new work. Keep it current as features are planned and delivered.

## How to use this file

- Use this document as the first stop when asking "what should we build next?"
- Start from **Product goals** (summary), then read **Ideal solutions by goal**
  for strategy and work pieces before picking backlog rows.
- Add new candidate features here as they are discovered.
- Keep each feature scoped as a capability, not a task list.
- Link implemented features to the docs that now describe them.

## Maintenance rules (required)

When implementing a feature:

1. Move it from **Planned Backlog** to **Implemented History**.
2. Update the matching row in **Product goals** (status + "done when").
3. Tick or revise the relevant **work pieces** under Ideal solutions when a
   slice ships (do not delete strategy text — mark pieces done).
4. Add:
   - implementation PR/commit reference (if available),
   - primary guide/docs path,
   - brief note on where it lives in code.
5. If a feature is fully shipped and documented elsewhere, remove it from Planned Backlog.

When proposing a new feature:

1. Prefer attaching it to a **work piece** under Ideal solutions, then add a
   Planned Backlog row that points at that piece.
2. Include the likely system seams it reuses (ontology, bridge, solver, cartridges, obd-gateway, etc.).
3. Keep prioritization honest: update priority and status fields, do not leave stale entries.

## Product goals (why this app exists)

These are the major reasons for the product. Status is relative to a **complete
single-operator garage** tool — not “does any code exist.” Ideal shape and
multi-piece plans live in the next section.

| Goal | Status | What exists today | Done when | Closing backlog |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Scanning** — ingest OBD evidence | **partial** | Simulate/API ingest; live gauge strip + FF/Mode06 UI; source labels | Live MX+ path proven; drive sessions; retention policy | Live MX+ dry-run (S1 hardware); GatewayScanCommands UI done |
| **Analysis** — prove fault classes from evidence | **partial** | Recognition + narration + evidence; ~134 P0xxx circuit/emission seed | Full J1979/J2012 catalog + teaching-grade cause briefs | A4/S7; **A6–A7** causal model + apprentice brief |
| **Diagnosis (probabilistic)** — ranked next steps under uncertainty | **partial** | Outcome shrink-calibration; counterfactuals + disqualified UI | Ranked steps *and* understandable differentials | **A6–A7**, **X6**; D5 LLM only after structured causes |
| **Informing the user** — clear operator / apprentice surfaces | **partial** | Source badges, narration, AEMF, calibration chips, empty-evidence honesty | Apprentice can explain vehicle + problem + fix from the UI | **A7**, I7, **V1**; I5 package |
| **Recommendations** — what to do next | **partial** | Class + campaign cards; accept/dismiss/convert; OEM steps in A7 brief | Deeper campaign→repair playbooks | **R6**; RecommendationService |
| **Problem tracking** — open cases through solve | **shipped** | Caseboard filters; abandon/escalate/reopen; `worked` → verifying → verify check | — | — |
| **Problem history** — cases over time | **partial** | Case timeline + filters + evidence/session deep-links | Stronger batch-level evidence anchors | Durable observation history |
| **Solution history** — what fixed what, confirmed over time | **partial** | Rollup + panel + sample-size UX (F10); verify-before-solved | Live multi-vehicle priors polish | Multi-signal trends |
| **History → better future decisions** | **partial** | Trends + calibration + LearningCycle + knowledge-gap queue (F9–F11) | Live evidence fuel (S1); optional LLM advise | Live MX+; optional LLM advise |
| **Reporting** — shareable diagnostic note | **partial** | Markdown + garage JSON/CSV export/import; Learning section | Print/PDF polish | Print-friendly HTML/PDF |

**Spine that already works:** ingest → realize → draft/solve → recommend → policy hold → log-repair → verify → Journal.  
**Not yet a complete garage product:** live scan UX reliability, second-vehicle OEM depth, richer AEMF framing.

### North star — “You are the vehicle”

Learn everything lawfully available from OBD-II / CAN (and guided enhanced
sessions when scoped): be informed, recommend, decide, enact (or guide)
actions, and remember outcomes for sure reference. The operator experiences a
principled companion that models the vehicle’s state — never invents meaning
outside propose/dispose.

**Ontological learning tactic — AEMF (Air / Electricity / Mechanical / Fluid):**
every fault class, recommendation, and playbook should be situable in one or
more of these media. Delivery and ranking stay evidence-backed; AEMF is framing
for comprehension and playbook selection, not a second classifier.

| Aspect | Typical OBD/CAN signals | Example classes |
|---|---|---|
| **Air** | MAF/MAP, O2, fuel trim, EVAP, EGR, secondary air | Lean/Rich, Evap*, Catalyst*, O2*, Egr*, SecondaryAir* |
| **Electricity** | Circuit DTCs, coil/injector/sensor circuits, heaters | *CircuitFault, IgnitionCoil*, Injector*, Knock*, TPS*, O2Heater* |
| **Mechanical** | Misfire under load, cam/crank correlation, VVT Mode 06 | MisfireUnderLoad, CamCrankCorrelationFault |
| **Fluid** | Oil trends, coolant/thermostat, MultiAir oil starvation | ChronicOilConsumption, Coolant*, MultiAirOilStarvation |

**Integrity boundary for actuation:** Mode 01–07 + guided external procedures
remain the default. Bi-directional UDS / flashing stay out of scope until an
explicit enhanced-session project — memory and recommendations must still work.

**Apprentice diagnoser tactic — teach, don’t just rank:**
The operator (and future apprentice) should leave each case understanding
(1) the vehicle identity and systems in play, (2) what evidence proved which
fault class, (3) *why* that class tends to happen (causes / differentials),
(4) what to try next and how history on *this* vehicle informs it, and
(5) what “fixed” meant last time. Ranking without teaching is incomplete.
`CausalModel` on `DiagnosticProblem` exists but is unused — fill it from
cartridges + evidence (propose); LOGOS still disposes membership.

**Cross-cutting product strategy (applies to every goal):**

1. **Propose / dispose stays sacred** — heuristics and LLMs may suggest; LOGOS
   proves class membership, policy, and ranked actions. Never let UI or gateway
   invent fault meaning.
2. **Evidence adjacent to every claim** — if the operator cannot see *why*, the
   claim is incomplete (`UX_GUIDELINES`).
3. **One garage, durable facts** — Postgres is the production store; memory is
   for tests/demo only when validating logic.
4. **Ship thin vertical slices** — each work piece below should be deliverable
   alone and still leave the spine green.
5. **Prefer reuse over new surfaces** — extend Dashboard / Diagnosis / Journal /
   ProblemDetail before inventing nav items.
6. **AEMF framing** — prefer situating proven classes and recommendations in
   air/electricity/mechanical/fluid without inventing membership.
7. **Teach the differential** — every proven class should eventually carry a
   causal brief (symptoms → possible causes → what evidence supports now →
   what to prove next), composed from ontology + live data + this vehicle’s
   history — never from invented realize membership.
8. **Continuous improvement** — discover → log here → build by value/priority
   (integrity → causal teaching spine → live evidence → ontology depth → UX).

## Ideal solutions by goal

Each subsection: **ideal product**, **strategy**, **work pieces** (build order
roughly top→bottom), **seams**, **anti-patterns**. Status tags on pieces:
`[done]` / `[partial]` / `[todo]`.

### 1. Scanning — ingest OBD evidence

**Ideal product.** Connecting the adapter feels boringly reliable. One button
(or CLI) runs a structured scan; optional watch records a *drive session*. DTCs,
PIDs, freeze-frames, and Mode 06 land in durable storage with source
(`obd_gateway` | `simulated` | `manual_entry`), timestamps, and odometer.
Dashboard shows freshness. The operator never wonders whether they are looking
at live bus data or a simulation.

**Strategy.** Treat scanning as a **pipeline**, not a page: edge capture →
validated batch → store → freshness UI. Prove hardware early (MX+ dry-run)
before investing in polish. Prefer session grouping over dumping raw batches
into the Journal forever.

| # | Work piece | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | Validated live MX+ dry-run on Jeep (scan + watch → Dashboard) | partial | Dashboard copyable gateway commands shipped; hardware validation still operator checklist |
| S2 | Live gauge strip (RPM, load, fuel trim, coolant) + stale indicators | done | `GET .../live-gauges`, `LiveGaugeStrip` |
| S3 | Mode 06 + freeze-frame capture already in batches → **surface in UI** | done | Edge `read_freeze_frames` / `read_mode06` + `EvidencePanels` |
| S4 | DriveSession object (start/stop; batches linked by `sessionId`) | done | `DriveSessionService`; simulate path; Dashboard panel |
| S5 | Retention policy (keep FF/Mode06 forever; downsample high-rate PIDs) | done | `applyRetention` / prune; keep evidence; hourly PID downsample |
| S6 | Bluetooth / preferred-adapter discovery | todo | Friction reduction after S1 works manually |
| S7 | SAE PID/DTC dictionary depth for scan interpretation | partial | ~134 P0xxx + coil/MAP/knock/injector/TPS; still not full J1979 |

**Seams:** `apps/obd-gateway`, `ObservationsService`, store batches, Dashboard.  
**Anti-patterns:** Classifying faults in the gateway; silent simulate-vs-live;
building a “scan dashboard” that bypasses `POST .../observations`.

---

### 2. Analysis — prove fault classes from evidence

**Ideal product.** Recognition answers: *which fault classes are proven from
current evidence?* Each proven class shows supporting DTCs/PIDs/freeze-frame/
Mode 06 and a short plain-English proof **plus a teaching-grade causal brief**
(why this happens, differentials, what to prove next). Undecided / not-proven
stays visible — the system never invents “Healthy.” Cartridge coverage grows
with the SAE KB and engine-family views, not with ad-hoc UI strings.

**Strategy.** Keep **perceive → realize** as the only path to class membership.
Invest in *explanation, causal structure, and evidence adjacency*, not
alternate classifiers. Expand dictionaries and ontology views so perception
has more lawful fuel. Populate `CausalModel` from cartridge catalogs + current
`classEvidence` (propose); compose apprentice briefs from that + AEMF + history.

| # | Work piece | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Evidence panel per `mostSpecific` class | done | `Recognition.classEvidence` + `ClassEvidencePanel` (no Mode 06 in v1) |
| A2 | Wire `verbalize` into Recognition API + Diagnosis UI | done | `Recognition.narration` + ontology-note fallback |
| A3 | Mode 06 as recognition input where ontology allows | done | Thin SAE/ISO OBDMID seed → perception → realize; unknown MIDs unlabeled |
| A4 | Broader curated DTC/PID KB + ontology lint parity | partial | + coil/injector/MAP/knock/TPS circuit families; still not full J2012 |
| A5 | Engine-family cartridge depth (MultiAir real; EcoTec3 when truck exists) | partial | SAE set shared; GM stub inert until real truck |
| A6 | Populate `CausalModel` on draft/solve from cartridge cause catalogs + live `classEvidence` | done | `composeCausalModel`; misfire/lean authored; fallback from playbook; ProblemDetail panel |
| A7 | Apprentice **causal brief** read-model + Diagnosis/ProblemDetail panel | done | `CausalBriefService` + panel: why / how we know / prove next + AEMF + history |

**Seams:** cartridges, `RecognitionService`, logos-bridge `realize`/`verbalize`,
dictionaries, Diagnosis/Dashboard, `CausalModel`, solution-history.  
**Anti-patterns:** UI-only “likely misfire” badges; LLM classifying without
realize; hiding undecided membership; causal prose that invents class membership.

---

### 3. Diagnosis (probabilistic) — ranked next steps under uncertainty

**Ideal product.** A diagnostic case is a first-class `DiagnosticProblem` with
clear current/desired state **and a filled causal model the apprentice can
read**. `solve` returns ranked actions with honest uncertainty: solver scores
*plus* priors from this vehicle’s (and optionally engine-family) confirmed
outcomes. Policy can forbid unsafe shortcuts (e.g. clear-codes under oil
starvation). Counterfactuals explain “why not #1.” Differentials explain
“why coil before injector.” Probability language is calibrated — never fake
precision.

**Strategy.** Today’s solve is **scoring under constraints**, not Bayesian
posteriors. Do not pretend otherwise. Close the loop:
`log-repair` outcomes → empirical priors → adjust playbook confidence / solve
inputs → re-rank. Keep policy defeasible and fail-closed. Prefer **A6/A7
structured causes** before optional LLM; LLM may *propose* framing or
candidate causes/actions against that structure; LOGOS still disposes.

| # | Work piece | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Draft/solve + policy holds (MVP path) | done | ActionService + PolicyService |
| D2 | Surface counterfactuals / disqualified actions in UI | done | `Explainability.tsx` on ProblemDetail; FakeLogosBridge emits thin CFs |
| D3 | Outcome → playbook confidence / action priors | done | `calibration.ts` → draft/solve/refresh |
| D4 | Family-level priors (same engineFamily) with small-sample caution | done | Family buckets + higher `k` |
| D5 | Optional propose-only LLM advise pass (draft candidates / cause gloss) | planned | After A6/A7; never skip realize/reason/solve; never invent membership |

**Seams:** `ActionService`, `SolverService`, `PolicyService`, cartridges,
`ProblemOutcome` / `DecisionRecord`.  
**Anti-patterns:** Calling scores “probabilities” before calibration; soft UI
override of Forbid; solve without `desiredState.successCriteria`.

---

### 4. Informing the user — clear operator surfaces

**Ideal product.** Four intent-grouped surfaces stay primary: Operate
(Dashboard), Diagnose, Reference (campaigns), History (Journal + case timeline).
Every claim has evidence. Safety holds are loud. Sim vs live is labeled.
Shared trust primitives (status pills, empty/error, evidence panels) stop each
page inventing its own language. Internals stay behind Debug.

**Strategy.** Follow `UX_GUIDELINES`: goal-grouped nav, progressive disclosure,
evidence with claims. Prefer deepening existing pages over new top-level routes.
Ship `@auto/ui-components` once patterns repeat twice.

| # | Work piece | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| I1 | Goal-grouped nav + vehicle switcher | done | Dashboard / Diagnosis / Campaigns / Journal |
| I2 | Evidence source labeling (sim / live / manual) everywhere data shows | done | Dashboard + Diagnosis via `GET .../evidence-provenance` |
| I3 | Live gauges + Mode 06 + freeze-frame panels | done | Gauges + FF/Mode06 on Dashboard |
| I4 | Verbalized proofs on Diagnosis / ProblemDetail | done | Narration on Dashboard/Diagnosis |
| I5 | Shared `@auto/ui-components` | partial | Thin EmptyEvidenceState in web-ui; full package later |
| I6 | Staleness / “last observation” chrome on Dashboard | done | Fresh/Stale badge on gauge strip |
| I7 | Diagnosis proven list: fluent narration primary, class id secondary | done | Undrafted + caseboard lead with fluent; class id mono secondary |
| V1 | Vehicle dossier strip on Diagnosis (profile + VIN/odo ritual + discovery + campaigns) | done | `VehicleDossierStrip` + `PATCH /api/vehicles/:id`; never invents VIN |

**Seams:** web-ui pages, `UX_GUIDELINES`, api-client queryKeys, vehicle profiles.  
**Anti-patterns:** Flat 17-item nav; theorem-prover chrome in operator mode;
claims without evidence; teaching panels that hide which vehicle they are about.

---

### 5. Recommendations — what to do next

**Ideal product.** Recommendations are the **operator-facing shortlist** derived
from proven classes (and campaigns), not a second brain. Each card shows title,
why (classes + evidence link), priority, confidence, rough cost/risk, and
status lifecycle (new → accepted → converted_to_repair / dismissed). Refresh
after new observations. History (“coil swap worked last time”) can raise
priority — but never invent a class that realize did not prove.

**Strategy.** Keep `refresh` driven by recognition. Enrich cards and feed
calibration/rollup into priority. Link recommendations to problems when a case
is opened (`generatedByProblem`).

| # | Work piece | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Refresh from `mostSpecific` + cartridge drafts | done | RecommendationService |
| R2 | Card richness: confidence, cost/risk, evidence deep-link | done | Playbook cost/risk on refresh; Evidence + Diagnosis links |
| R3 | Status lifecycle in UI (accept / dismiss / convert) | done | Accept/dismiss + convert→ActionService; open-only shortlist |
| R4 | History-aware priority from solution rollup + calibration | done | One-step bump when worked≥2 clean |
| R5 | Campaign-backed recommendations (TSB/recall → actionable card) | done | Refresh emits W80/W84/TSB cards; empty classes; Campaigns link |
| R6 | Campaign/TSB steps linked into A7 causal brief (“OEM also says…”) | done | `oemAlsoSays` on CausalBrief; relatedClasses + steps in known-campaigns |

**Seams:** `RecommendationService`, recognition, campaigns, Dashboard, A7.  
**Anti-patterns:** Recommendations that invent fault classes; burying cost/risk;
refresh that ignores policy holds for unsafe actions.

---

### 6. Problem tracking — open cases through solve

**Ideal product.** The Diagnosis page is a **caseboard**: filter by status,
urgency, vehicle; open → analyzing → solved / escalated / abandoned. From a
proven class, one click drafts a problem with good framing. Solve ranks next
steps. After a repair is logged, the case enters **verify** (watch for DTC
return / PID sanity) before it is truly closed. Reopen is first-class when the
fault returns.

**Strategy.** MVP CRUD is enough to start cases; the product leap is lifecycle
+ verify-after-repair, not more fields on `DiagnosticProblem`.

| # | Work piece | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Create / get / list / solve problems | done | API + Diagnosis + ProblemDetail |
| P2 | Caseboard filters + abandon / escalate UX | done | Diagnosis filters + lifecycle actions |
| P3 | Draft-from-recognition one-click | done | Hidden while an *active* case exists for the class |
| P4 | Verify-after-repair workflow (success criteria check) | done | `worked` → `verifying`; verify re-runs recognition |
| P5 | Reopen with lineage to prior case / decision | done | `reopenedFromId`; clears verification |

**Seams:** `DiagnosticProblem`, ActionService, Diagnosis UI, observations.  
**Anti-patterns:** Solving without a problem; deleting cases instead of
abandoning; “solved” with no outcome or verify step.

---

### 7. Problem history — cases over time

**Ideal product.** For each vehicle, a chronological **case timeline**: opened,
evidence snapshots, solves, decisions, outcomes, verify results, reopens —
with odometer and drive-session context. Journal remains the decision audit;
the timeline is the case narrative. Postgres retention makes this survive
restarts.

**Strategy.** Don’t overload Journal. Add timeline views on Diagnosis /
ProblemDetail fed by problems + decisions + linked sessions. Durable batches
are the evidence spine under each event.

| # | Work piece | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | Durable problem + decision persistence | done | Postgres store |
| H2 | Case timeline UI (events from problem + decisions) | done | Durable `lifecycleEvents` + decisions; Diagnosis + ProblemDetail |
| H3 | Attach odometer / session to case events | done | Stamped on lifecycle + DecisionRecord; CaseTimelinePanel shows mi / session |
| H4 | Filter history by class, status, date, mileage | done | `CaseTimelinePanel` client filters |
| H5 | Deep link timeline event → evidence batch / freeze-frame | done | Evidence + `#session:…` → DriveSessionsPanel highlight |
| H6 | Operator-entered complaint / symptom journal → framing input | done | Draft chips → `operatorComplaints` enrich statement/symptoms; never invent realize classes |

**Seams:** problems, decisions, DriveSession, ObservationsService, Diagnosis.  
**Anti-patterns:** Journal-as-only-history; losing evidence when a problem is
marked solved; treating complaints as proven fault classes.

---

### 8. Solution history — confirmed fixes through time

**Ideal product.** Every enacted repair is a `DecisionRecord` with optional
`ProblemOutcome`. Queries answer: *What fixed `MisfireUnderLoad` on this Jeep?
On this engine family?* Success/fail/partial rates are visible. Confirmed
solutions become the memory that calibration and recommendations read — not a
separate wiki.

**Strategy.** Write path exists (`log-repair`). Build **read models** (rollups)
before fancy ML. Require outcome status when closing a case. Prefer explicit
confirmation (“worked after 50 mi verify”) over assuming solve ≡ fixed.

| # | Work piece | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| X1 | log-repair → DecisionRecord + ProblemOutcome | done | ActionService |
| X2 | Journal list with outcome pills | done | thin but real |
| X3 | Rollup API: by vehicle, class, engineFamily, actionId | done | `GET .../solution-history?class=` |
| X4 | “What worked before” panel on Diagnosis / ProblemDetail | done | `WhatWorkedPanel` |
| X5 | Require / encourage outcome + verify before terminal solved | done | `log-repair` worked → verifying; verify closes or reopens |
| X6 | Solution narrative cards for apprentices | done | `SolutionNarrativeCard` on solution-history; WhatWorked stories + A7 historyNotes prefer lessons |

**Seams:** `DecisionRecord`, `ProblemOutcome`, RecommendationsService, Journal, A7.  
**Anti-patterns:** Outcomes that never get recorded; rollups that ignore
sample size; treating dismissed recommendations as confirmed fixes.

---

### 9. History → better future decisions & recommendations

**Ideal product.** Two memory lanes feed the future:

1. **Signal memory** — PID/Mode06/DTC trends and forecasts (oil today; more
   signals later) influence recognition when ontology allows.
2. **Outcome memory** — confirmed repairs shift priors and recommendation
   priority for the next similar case.

A third lane, **cascade prognosis**, answers on command: *given what is already
proven or open, what high-confidence common failures are likely next?* It is
not a second recognition engine and not actuarial insurance math — it is a
curated, evidence-cited watchlist of next risks.

The operator sees *why* a priority moved (“worked 2/2 times on this vehicle”)
and *why* a cascade is listed (“catalyst damage risk because misfire under load
is proven + drive-cycle heat”). Small samples shrink toward cartridge defaults —
never overfit one lucky fix. Likelihood uses **ordinal bands** (`Watch` /
`Elevated` / `High`) plus cited evidence and optional time/mileage **ranges** —
not fake %-chance-of-failure until outcome data can honestly support it.

**Strategy.** Keep lanes separate. Do not let trends invent classes outside
realize. Calibration is the flagship piece; multi-signal trends expand
ForecastService carefully with ontology backing. Cascade prognosis is a
**multi-phase** feature (see Planned Backlog): start with OBD fault-class edges
seeded from the same DL/cartridge spine, then optionally add a thin
operator-entered mechanical wear layer that shares the same edge schema —
never invent pad/rotor/bearing state from Mode 01 alone.

| # | Work piece | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | Oil-level trend → recognition evidence | done | ForecastService (narrow) |
| F2 | Outcome → confidence calibration into refresh + solve priors | done | `calibratePlaybook` |
| F3 | Multi-signal trends (fuel trim, coolant, load-at-misfire) | done | RisingFuelTrim / RecurringHighLoad → realize; coolant informing-only |
| F4 | Session-aware trends (per drive, not only global series) | done | `GET .../forecast?sessionId=`; Dashboard drive-scope picker; recognition stays global |
| F5 | Explainability chip: “priority raised because …” | done | `Recommendation.calibrationExplain` + `CalibrationExplainChip` |
| F6 | Cascade edge catalog (OBD fault-class → next-risk) in ontology/cartridges | done | `cascade-edges.json` + `listCascadeEdges` |
| F7 | On-command CascadePrognosisService + UI (ordinal bands + evidence + horizons) | done | API + Diagnosis `CascadePrognosisPanel` |
| F8 | Optional mechanical wear layer (operator-entered stages) on same edge schema | done | 9 conditions (brakes/hub/CV/belt/hose) + cascade edges; Diagnosis checkboxes |
| F9 | LearningCycle read-model (compose from problems + decisions + calibration) | done | `LearningCycleService`; `GET .../learning-cycles`; Diagnosis/ProblemDetail panel |
| F10 | Sample-size UX on WhatWorked / recs / calibration chips / reports | done | `calibrationMeta`; n= chips; report Learning section |
| F11 | KnowledgeGap proposal queue (detect + accept/dismiss + export; never auto-write TBox) | done | `KnowledgeGapService`; store `gapProposals`; Diagnosis/Journal panel |
| F12 | AEMF aspect catalog (air/electricity/mechanical/fluid) on fault classes | done | Catalog + chips + per-aspect/class playbook prose on recs / Diagnosis / ProblemDetail |
| F13 | Logos-bridge subprocess via temp file (not stdin) for reliable realize | done | `@seam/logos-bridge` `runJson` writes temp JSON path (no stdin hang) |
| F14 | Batched realize classify (avoid full-view tableau hang) | done | RecognitionService chunks view classes; scope:auto per batch |

**Seams:** ForecastService, recognition, RecommendationsService, SolverService,
solution rollups; CascadePrognosisService + ontology cascade edges; AEMF catalog.  
**Anti-patterns:** Black-box ML ranking; silent priority changes; using
simulated history to calibrate production priors; presenting actuarial
failure % without outcome backing; inventing mechanical wear from the bus;
using AEMF as a second realize engine.

---

### 10. Reporting — shareable diagnostic note

**Ideal product.** From a vehicle or a problem, export a **shop note**: vehicle
identity, odometer, observation summary, proven classes (verbalized), open/
solved problems, ranked actions, policy holds, decisions/outcomes, linked
campaigns. Markdown first (copy/share); print stylesheet second; PDF optional.
Reports are compose-only — they never become a new source of truth.

**Strategy.** Reporting is a **read-model composition** over existing APIs.
Ship Markdown export as soon as verbalize + decisions are good enough; polish
print later. One template, two scopes (vehicle snapshot vs single case).

| # | Work piece | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| G1 | Report compose service (vehicle \| problem scope) | done | `ReportService` |
| G2 | Markdown download / copy | done | `ReportDownload` |
| G2b | Garage JSON dump + CSV tables + JSON import | done | `GarageExportService`, Journal panel |
| G3 | Print-friendly HTML / PDF | done | Report `html` + print CSS; Print button (browser print-to-PDF) |
| G4 | Include verbalized proofs + campaign refs | done | Narration + campaigns in Markdown |
| G5 | Optional “attach last drive session summary” | done | Report `lastSession` + Markdown/HTML section |

**Seams:** recognition, problems, decisions, campaigns, verbalize, Journal.  
**Anti-patterns:** Editing domain facts inside a report; PDF-only first;
reports that claim classes not returned by realize.

---

## Planned Backlog

Ordered roughly by product-goal impact. Prefer closing **partial** / **missing**
goals before nice-to-haves. Ideal-solution piece ids (S1, A2, …) are the
canonical breakdown; backlog rows are schedulable delivery units.

### Market UX research (2026) → backlog seeds

Competitive scan (BlueDriver, FIXD, OBDLink + Torque/FORScan, Car Scanner ELM,
Carista/OBDeleven coding apps). Auto-architect’s differentiator remains
propose/dispose + durable garage memory — we steal *clarity*, not subscriptions
or proprietary enhanced-PID lock-in.

| Insight from market | Our gap | Backlog response | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| BlueDriver/FIXD: immediate “what fixed this / what next” | Dashboard listed evidence without a single next-step hero | **UX1** Next-action console (done this cycle) | — |
| BlueDriver: verified-fix reports from shop outcomes | WhatWorked exists but not next to DTC rows | **UX2** DTC-row “what worked” chips from solution history | high |
| Torque/OBDLink: fast live PIDs + custom dash | Per-vehicle Mode 01 layout + Customize on Live gauges | **UX3** done (local prefs; not garage-export) | — |
| Smog/readiness tiles in consumer apps | STATUS → `imStatus` + Dashboard monitor tiles | **UX4** done (still not a legal smog cert) | — |
| Shop tools: permanent DTCs after clear | Gateway now captures Mode 0A (thin AT) | **S8** done | — |
| FORScan/Carista: deep module maps | Full CAN/UDS map is OEM-proprietary; out of MVP scope | **CAN1** Research note + guided discover depth only (no invented bus map) | medium |
| Plain-English first | Narration leads next-action + proven list; DTC tooltips carry fluent | **UX5** done | — |
| One-tap scan ritual | Dashboard copyable dry-run/live/watch; browser still cannot hit MX+ | **S1** hardware validation still open | critical |

**CAN bus mapping principle:** Do not invent a whole-vehicle CAN matrix from
generic OBD-II. Map *what we can lawfully observe* (Mode 01–07, discovery bits,
freeze frame, Mode 06 seeds) and grow OEM cartridges from evidence + TSBs.
Enhanced UDS/module trees stay behind an explicit project (Functions / external
tool), never fake completeness.

### Discovery — apprentice-smart diagnosis (2026-07-22)

**Product ask:** Be the smartest *and* most informative diagnoser — pull all
lawful vehicle information; diagnose from **symptoms + live data + ontology +
vehicle history**; explain causes so an apprentice fully understands the
vehicle, the problem, and the solutions.

**What already ships (spine is real):** perceive → realize → draft/solve →
recommend → verify → Journal; AEMF framing; fluent narration (membership
proofs); classEvidence; WhatWorked / LearningCycle / calibration; counterfactuals;
cascade watchlist; case timeline. Types include `CausalModel` on
`DiagnosticProblem` but cartridges **do not fill it**.

**Market / pedagogy gap (vs shop mentors + consumer apps):** BlueDriver/FIXD
lead with “what next” and verified-fix stats; good mentors teach
*differentials* (“why coil before injector,” “how EVAP leak tests work”). We
rank and prove membership well; we under-teach **cause structure** and
**history-as-story**. Ontology `notes` are SAE-membership glosses, not root-cause
lessons. Diagnosis UI is still more class-id-forward than Dashboard UX5.

| Insight | Our gap | Backlog response | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mentors narrate causes + differentials | `CausalModel` unused; notes ≠ teaching | **A6** fill causal model from cartridges + evidence | critical |
| Apprentice needs one “why / how we know / prove next” surface | Panels are fragmented (AEMF, evidence, WhatWorked, CFs) | **A7** composed causal brief on Diagnosis + ProblemDetail | critical |

**Build order (logical):**
`A6` → `A7` (+ `I7` polish) → `X6` → `V1` → `H6` → `R6` (done) → continue `A4` → `D5`.

**Integrity:** Causal briefs and LLM advise may *propose* causes and lessons;
realize still owns class membership; empty DTCs / missing STATUS never mean
healthy; history never invents a fix that was not logged and verified.

#### Design note — Cascade prognosis (parked for research)

**Working name:** Cascade prognosis (UI: “Likely next” / “What may go next”).  
**Not:** a replacement for `ForecastService` PID projections, nor actuarial
insurance probabilities.

**Likelihood (decided leaning):** ordinal bands only — `Watch` / `Elevated` /
`High` — plus cited evidence and optional time or mileage **ranges**. Do **not**
ship %-chance-of-failure as real probability until outcome history can back it.
Optional later: a 0–1 *score* labeled as curated prior × evidence weight
(explicitly not actuarial).

**Scope options researched (pick / hybrid when unparking):**

| Id | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **1A** | OBD / diagnostic cascades only — edges among fault classes & Trends already in the ontology spine (e.g. misfire under load → catalyst damage risk; oil decline → MultiAir starvation). |
| **1B** | 1A plus a small curated **mechanical wear** catalog that requires **operator-entered** stage (pad wear, rotor condition, bearing noise, etc.) — never invented from Mode 01/03 alone. |
| **Hybrid (recommended when returning)** | One shared **cascade-edge** schema; two evidence *sources*: (1) bus-backed / realize-proven antecedents, (2) operator-asserted wear stages. Same prognosis UI and ordinal bands. |

**Clever multi-phase shape (initial thought to revisit later):**

1. **Phase F6 — Edge catalog.** Declare a small set of high-confidence, common
   `antecedent → consequent` edges in ontology/cartridges (role or JSON catalog
   with: consequent class or watch-concept, ordinal prior band, optional
   horizon range template, required evidence kinds, citation / shop rationale).
   Prefer edges operators already believe (catalyst after chronic misfire; oil
   starvation after chronic oil loss) over exotic long chains.
2. **Phase F7 — On-command prognosis (1A-shaped).** Service loads current
   recognition + open problems + flagged Trends; matches antecedents; emits a
   ranked watchlist with band + evidence citations + optional horizon. Propose
   only — does not invent proven classes; optional “open as watch problem”
   goes through ActionService. Surface on Diagnosis / ProblemDetail (reuse
   surfaces; avoid a new nav item unless volume demands it).
3. **Phase F8 — Wear layer (1B-shaped).** Same edge matcher; antecedents may
   also be `manualCondition` stages on the vehicle (or problem). Mechanical
   cascades (pads → rotors → hubs/bearings) live here. OBD never invents pad
   thickness.

**Integrity rules:** ontology owns consequent meaning; heuristics/LLM may
propose edges later but LOGOS/`realize` still owns *current* class membership;
empty watchlist is honest; simulated batches must not quietly inflate bands;
update Mastery Guide when this ships (`UX_GUIDELINES` §4).

**Why parked:** needs research on which cascades are high-confidence & common
enough for this garage, and how much mechanical wear entry operators will
actually maintain.

## Explicit non-goals (for now)

- Reverse-engineering proprietary FCA enhanced diagnostics / AlfaOBD session cloning into `obd-gateway`
- In-app bi-directional Proxi / UDS over MX+ without an explicit enhanced-session project (guided external procedures **are** in scope)
- Direct ECU flashing or bi-directional actuator control from this app
- Claiming dealer-complete coverage from Mode 01–07 alone
- Multi-tenant SaaS before local single-operator durability exists
- Claiming calibrated probabilistic diagnosis before repair outcomes feed rankings
- Actuarial %-chance-of-failure / insurance-style prognosis without outcome-backed calibration (cascade prognosis, when built, uses ordinal bands + evidence — see F6–F8)
